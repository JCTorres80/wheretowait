              where servers and bartenders get an inside scoop on some of the best places to work. Fellow members of the
              service industry anonymously share their experiences working at different establishments, so you can pick
              the establishment that’s right for you. Ever trained at a new job to come and realize it’s not what you
              expected? We’re here to prevent that.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Review Anonymously</h2>

            <p>The best way to keep the database active and updated is to contribute by reviewing places that you have
              previously or currently work at. Don’t worry about angry employers, we keep your reviews 100% anonymous.
              Post reviews to help others, and simultaneously read reviews from others to help yourself.</p>

            <p>Want to review an establishment that isn’t posted? Type the name and location of the establishment, and
              it will give you an option to add it to our database. Ratings are uniquely calculated through a brief
              questionnaire that gathers information on some of the biggest concerns of wait staff. Then you have the
              option to write specifically about your experience.</p>
